importance of relational databases
###################################
OG rule 1 = information rule
all info in a relational database is represented explicity at a logical level and in exactly one way = by values in tables

1. standardization of the data model
once the data is transformed into rows and columns format your data is standardized
can be queried using SQL

2. flexibility in adding and altering tables
relational databases give you flexibility to add tables, alter tables, and remove data

3. data integrity
strong data typing = avoid inserting data that will cause curroption

4. SQL
standard language to acces the data

5. simplicity
data is systematically stored and modeled in tabular format

6. intuitive organization
models should be an intuitive 

###################################
OLAP vs OLTP
###################################
OLAP = online analytical processing
allow for complex analytical and ad-hoc queries
focus on aggregations
optimized for reads

OLTP = online transactional processing
less complex queries in large volumes
for read, insert, update, and delete queries

###################################
normalization vs denormalization
###################################
normalization
process of structuring a relational database in accordance with a series of normal forms
organize so that dependencies are properly enforced by database integrity constraints 
reduce data redudency = minimize storage, avoid out-of-date data
increase data integrity = want to update the data in one place and have that be the source of truth 

objectives of normal form
1. free the database from unwanted insertions, updates, and deletion dependencies
if I have to update my data, I want to update just in one place
2. reduce the need to refactor the database as new types of data are introduced 
3. make the relational model more informative to users
4. make the database neutral to query statistics

denormalization
must be done for read-heavy workflows to increase process
will not feel as natural
will have duplicate copies of your data
