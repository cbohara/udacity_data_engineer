data modeling intro
#####################
organize elements of data and how they relate to one another
easily translate to database modeling = final state of the model

process to support business and user applications
- need to know how much stock sold 
- need to know about the user activity

data must be retained and served to the business or the end users
data must be stored and persisted and how it will relate to each other

conceptual data modeling
entity mapping
giant whiteboarding session to connect how the data is related to one another

logical data modeling
move conceptual > logical
using the concept of tables, schemas, and columns 

physical data modeling
transforming logical plan > DDL (data definition language)

data organization is critical
determines later data use
need to make sure queries are simple and straightforward
iterative process

OLAP vs OLTP
###################################
OLAP = online analytical processing
allow for complex analytical and ad-hoc queries
focus on aggregations
optimized for reads

OLTP = online transactional processing
less complex queries in large volumes
for read, insert, update, and delete queries
