data modeling intro
#####################
organize elements of data and how they relate to one another
easily translate to database modeling = final state of the model

process to support business and user applications
- need to know how much stock sold 
- need to know about the user activity

data must be retained and served to the business or the end users
data must be stored and persisted and how it will relate to each other

conceptual data modeling
entity mapping
giant whiteboarding session to connect how the data is related to one another

logical data modeling
move conceptual > logical
using the concept of tables, schemas, and columns 

physical data modeling
transforming logical plan > DDL (data definition language)

data organization is critical
determines later data use
need to make sure queries are simple and straightforward
iterative process

###################################
OLAP vs OLTP
###################################
OLAP = online analytical processing
allow for complex analytical and ad-hoc queries
focus on aggregations
optimized for reads
use dimensional modeling for architecture design

OLTP = online transactional processing
less complex queries in large volumes
for read, insert, update, and delete queries
use entity-relationship modeling for architecture design

data warehouse
####################
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_warehouse
data warehouse
system used for reporting and data analysis 
central repositories of integrated data from 1+ disparate sources
store current and historical data in a single place
used for creating analytical reports throughout the enterprise 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mart
data mart = subset of data warehouse
usually oriented to specific business line or team
info in a data mart pertains to a specific department

data marts exist because info the in the database is not organized in a way that makes it readily accessible >
queries are too complicated + resource consuming

while transactional databases are designed to be updated, data warehouses + marts are read only
data warehouses are designed to access large groups of related records
data marts improve end-user response time by allowing users to have access to a specific type of data they need to view most often 
provide data in a way that supports the users

data warehousing helps implement
- fetching data from multiple heterogenous data sources
- clean, filter, and transform data for insights
- store the data in a form and manner that is easy to access, understand, and use
