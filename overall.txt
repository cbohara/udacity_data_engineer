OLAP vs OLTP
###################################
OLAP = online analytical processing
allow for complex analytical and ad-hoc queries
focus on aggregations
optimized for reads
use dimensional modeling for architecture design

OLTP = online transactional processing
less complex queries in large volumes
for read, insert, update, and delete queries
use normal modeling for architecture design

data warehouse
####################
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_warehouse
data warehouse
system used for reporting and data analysis 
central repositories of integrated data from 1+ disparate sources
store current and historical data in a single place
used for creating analytical reports throughout the enterprise 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mart
data mart = subset of data warehouse
usually oriented to specific business line or team
info in a data mart pertains to a specific department

data marts exist because info the in the database is not organized in a way that makes it readily accessible >
queries are too complicated + resource consuming

while transactional databases are designed to be updated, data warehouses + marts are read only
data warehouses are designed to access large groups of related records
data marts improve end-user response time by allowing users to have access to a specific type of data they need to view most often 
provide data in a way that supports the users

data warehousing helps implement
- fetching data from multiple heterogenous data sources
- clean, filter, and transform data for insights
- store the data in a form and manner that is easy to access, understand, and use
